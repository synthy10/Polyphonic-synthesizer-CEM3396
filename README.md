# Polyphonic-synthesizer-CEM3396

Homebuilt polyphonic synthesizer CEM3396

I want to take you with me on a trip to develop and build a polyphonic synth.
So far, i have a voice PCB which is at the moment on the test bench.
The idea is to control the voiceboards with a single ESP32 board.
This board takes care of the LFO (digital), the envelopes (digital) , the midi handling, the reading of the potentiometers and switches and the multiplexing to the seperate controls of the voiceboards.
